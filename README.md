# Rachna Softech LLP website

The company website for **Rachna Softech LLP**, an Indian software company building a family of everyday apps (to-do lists, personal finance, health and more). It is a single page plus legal pages, built with [Astro 7](https://astro.build) and Tailwind CSS 4, and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

**Live site:** [teamrachna.tech](https://teamrachna.tech) (once the domain is connected)

## Quick start

```sh
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:4321
npm run build     # production build in ./dist
npm run preview   # serve the production build locally
npm run check     # type-check .astro and .ts files
```

Builds use Node.js 24 (LTS), pinned in `package.json` and `.nvmrc` so Vercel never switches major versions on its own. Any Node.js 22.12+ works for local development.

## Where to edit things

| What to change | Where |
| --- | --- |
| **Products**: names, descriptions, features, status, links | `src/data/products.ts` |
| Company details: email, partners, LLPIN, GSTIN, address, phone, socials | `src/config/site.ts` |
| Live domain (canonical URLs, sitemap, robots.txt) | `SITE_URL` in `astro.config.mjs`, or the `SITE_URL` env var at build time |
| FAQ questions | `src/data/faqs.ts` |
| Home page sections | `src/components/home/*.astro` |
| Legal pages | `src/pages/privacy-policy.astro`, `terms.astro`, `cookie-policy.astro`, `refund-policy.astro` |
| Colours, fonts, shared styles | `src/styles/global.css` |
| Logo, favicons, social preview image | `scripts/generate-icons.mjs`, then run `npm run icons` |
| Hosting, caching and security headers | `vercel.json` |

### Products

`src/data/products.ts` drives the whole product story: the hero, the Products section and its category filters, the footer, the contact form's product list and the structured data.

- **Status:** one of `Live`, `Beta`, `In development` or `Coming soon`. It sets the badge and the call to action. Live products with a `url` get an "Open product" link; the others get a "Get in touch" link that pre-fills the contact form.
- **Key:** picks the mini preview drawn on the card (`tasks`, `money`, `health`, `notes`, `habits`). Any other key shows a simple generic preview.
- **Order:** products appear in the order they are listed. The hero badge announces the first Live product, otherwise the first Beta, otherwise the first In development product.

## Company details

Empty fields in `src/config/site.ts` are hidden automatically. Once you fill them in, they appear in the footer, the About section, the legal pages and the structured data.

## Contact form

With no configuration, the form opens the visitor's email app with their message pre-filled and addressed to `hello@teamrachna.tech`. To receive submissions directly, create a form endpoint with Formspree or Web3Forms and paste its URL into `contactFormEndpoint` in `src/config/site.ts`. Both services are already allowed by the Content Security Policy in `vercel.json`. Product cards and "Work with us" buttons pre-select the right topic and product in the form.

## Self-hosted, no third-party CDNs

Everything the site needs ships from this repository and is served from Vercel's own edge network:

- **Fonts:** Inter and Geist Mono are bundled through Fontsource, and the main font file is preloaded.
- **Photos:** stored in `src/assets/images/` and converted to responsive AVIF/WebP at build time.
- **Icons and illustrations:** inline SVG from Lucide and Simple Icons.
- **No tracking or external scripts.** The Content Security Policy only allows the site's own origin.

Hashed build assets (`/_astro/*`) are cached for a year; icons and the social image for a week.

## SEO

- Per-page `<title>`, meta description, canonical URL, robots and hreflang tags
- Open Graph and Twitter/X cards, with a 1200×630 preview image (`public/og-image.png`)
- JSON-LD structured data: Organization, WebSite, WebPage, product ItemList, FAQPage and BreadcrumbList
- `sitemap-index.xml` (via `@astrojs/sitemap`) and a `robots.txt` that points to it
- Web app manifest, SVG/ICO favicons, Apple touch icon and maskable icon

## Deploy on Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import this GitHub repository. Vercel detects Astro, and the build settings come from `vercel.json`.
2. Click **Deploy**. From then on, every push to `main` goes live automatically, and pull requests get their own preview links.
3. **Custom domain:** in the Vercel project, open **Settings → Domains** and add `teamrachna.tech` and `www.teamrachna.tech`. Set `www` to redirect to `teamrachna.tech`. Then add the DNS records Vercel shows you at your domain registrar. HTTPS is set up automatically.

The site is built for `https://teamrachna.tech`. If you make `www.teamrachna.tech` the main domain instead, set the environment variable `SITE_URL=https://www.teamrachna.tech` in Vercel and run `SITE_URL=https://www.teamrachna.tech npm run icons` locally so the preview image matches.

## Before going live

- [ ] Replace the product names, descriptions and statuses in `src/data/products.ts` with your real apps.
- [ ] Add the LLPIN and registered office address in `src/config/site.ts`. An LLP must show its name, LLPIN and registered office on its official publications.
- [ ] Make sure `hello@teamrachna.tech` is monitored. It is used for enquiries and as the Grievance Officer contact.
- [ ] Check that the statements on the site match reality, for example "no ads", "one account for all our apps", the one-day reply time and the refund terms (7-day window on annual plans, refunds within 7 business days).
- [ ] Have a lawyer or CA review the legal pages.
- [ ] Add partner photos or LinkedIn links if you want them on the About section.
